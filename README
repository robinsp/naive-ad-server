== Installation ==

Requires basic ruby-on-rails knowledge and that the following requirements are met:
  Ruby (1.8), Ruby Gems, rake

This Rails based ad server uses a file database and most of the components used have 
been "vendored in" to avoid as much configuration trouble as possible. 
However, the sqlite3-ruby gem requires local binaries to be present and has been left
out of the vendor tree.

1. To make sure sqlite3 is properly installed, run the following command in RAILS_ROOT:
  
  sudo rake gems:install
  
If any errors occur you should find an 'apt-get' command that will install the required Ubuntu
packages. (Most likely 'sudo apt-get install sqlite3 libsqlite3-dev')
Re-run 'sudo rake gems:install' after this.

2. Set up database the database with: 

  rake db:migrate
  
3. Start server with:

  ./script/server
  
You should now be able to browse to http://localhost:3000 and create your ads.
Remember to use the port in your iframe urls when testing the from the "publishing end"!

The specs are of course run with 'rake spec'
